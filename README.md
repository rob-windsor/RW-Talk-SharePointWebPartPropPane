# SharePoint Framework Deep Dive - Web Part Property Pane

The session title says it all. In this session we will take a deep dive into working with properties and the property pane in SharePoint Framework web parts. Along the way we will look at topics like: property value validation, using the native property pane controls, using the PnP property pane controls, and (if time allows) building custom property pane controls.
